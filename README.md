# Dead Dial
A non-functioning SwiftUI clone of Apple's Phone app.

Useful whenever you need to look like you're making a call without actually calling anybody. Very helpful in filmmaking, for example, where you might need to fake a phone call.

## Features:

* Dark/Light mode supported
* Looks very similar to Apple's Phone app
* Can simulate a failed call after a specified amount of time.

## Usage

Just download the project, open in Xcode, set your development team, and run. Supports iOS 15+.
Due to an Apple bug, you may not see the app icon until you restart your device.
